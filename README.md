# Jenkins Docker Spring React Cluster Project

* **Objective** - To create a product a Jenkins Pipeline which
	* dockerizes a `Spring` application of `Maven` archetype
	* dockerizes a `React` application
	* dockerizes a `Selenium` application of `Maven` archetype
	* runs integration tests on the Full Stack `Spring` & `React` application using the `Selenium` application
* **Purpose** - To gain familiarity with running multiple docker containers in a single Jenkins pipeline.

### Part 1 - Creating Maven Pipeline with this Project
* Please review the [Java Developer Notes](./webservice/README.md) for additional details on the Maven application
* Create a Jenkins pipeline which
	1. [Pulls a docker _image_ with `Git`, `Java` and `Maven` installed](https://hub.docker.com/r/jamesdbloom/docker-java8-maven)
	2. Creates a docker _container_ from the aforementioned docker _image_.
	3. `git clone`s [a maven Application](https://github.com/curriculeon/jenkins.docker.spring.react_projecttemplate/tree/master/pom.xml) into the container.
	4. `.jar`s the cloned maven application within the container by leveraging command below
		* `mvn package`
	5. runs `Spring` application using the `.jar` in container by leveraging command below
		* `java -jar target/${name-of-jar}.jar`
	6. ensure output of build is displayed by Jenkins
	* **Note** - Steps `iv` and `v` can be done in one step by leveraging the command below
		* `mvn spring-boot:run`
		
### Part 2 - Create React Pipeline with this Project
* Please review the [React Developer Notes](./client/README.md) for additional details on the React application
* Create a Jenkins pipeline which
	1. Pulls a docker _image_ with `Git`, and `Node` installed
	2. Creates a docker _container_ from the aforementioned docker _image_.
	3. `git clone`s [a react Application](https://github.com/curriculeon/jenkins.docker.spring.react_projecttemplate/tree/master/client) into the container.
	4. builds the react application inside the container
	6. ensures output of build is displayed by Jenkins



### Part 3 - Create Full Stack Application Pipeline with this Project
* Create a Jenkins pipeline which
	1. Dockerizes and Builds Maven Application

		2. Creates a docker _container_ from the aforementioned docker _image_.
		3. `git clone`s [a maven Application](https://github.com/curriculeon/jenkins.docker.spring.react_projecttemplate/tree/master/pom.xml) into the container.
		4. `.jar`s the cloned maven application within the container by leveraging command below
			* `mvn package`
		5. runs `Spring` application using the `.jar` in container by leveraging command below
			* `java -jar target/${name-of-jar}.jar`
		6. ensure output of build is displayed by Jenkins
	* **Note**
		* Steps `d` and `e` can be done in one step by leveraging the command below
			* `mvn spring-boot:run`
	2. Dockerizes and Builds React Application
		1. Pulls a docker _image_ with `Git`, and `Node` installed
		2. Creates a docker _container_ from the aforementioned docker _image_.
		3. `git clone`s [a react Application](https://github.com/curriculeon/jenkins.docker.spring.react_projecttemplate/tree/master/client) into the container.
		4. builds the react application inside the container
		6. ensures output of build is displayed by Jenkins



### Part 4 - Create Full Stack Application with Integration Testing Pipeline with this Project
* Please review the  [Test Automation Engineer Notes](./integration-testing/README.md) for additional details on the integration testing application
* Create a Jenkins pipeline which
	1. Dockerizes and Builds Maven Application
		1. [Pulls a docker _image_ with `Git`, `Java` and `Maven` installed](https://hub.docker.com/r/jamesdbloom/docker-java8-maven)
		2. Creates a docker _container_ from the aforementioned docker _image_.
		3. `git clone`s [a maven Application](https://github.com/curriculeon/jenkins.docker.spring.react_projecttemplate/tree/master/pom.xml) into the container.
		4. `.jar`s the cloned maven application within the container by leveraging command below
			* `mvn package`
		5. runs `Spring` application using the `.jar` in container by leveraging command below
			* `java -jar target/${name-of-jar}.jar`
		6. ensure output of build is displayed by Jenkins
	* **Note**
		* Steps `d` and `e` can be done in one step by leveraging the command below
			* `mvn spring-boot:run`
	2. Dockerizes and Builds React Application
		1. Pulls a docker _image_ with `Git`, and `Node` installed
		2. Creates a docker _container_ from the aforementioned docker _image_.
		3. `git clone`s [a react Application](https://github.com/curriculeon/jenkins.docker.spring.react_projecttemplate/tree/master/client) into the container.
		4. builds the react application inside the container
		6. ensures output of build is displayed by Jenkins
	3. Dockerizes and Runs Selenium Application
		1. Pulls a docker _image_ with `Git`, `Java`, and `Maven` installed.
